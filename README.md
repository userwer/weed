weed - XChat based theme for irssi
==============

This is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/weed) theme by rolle_, made to work in more recent times (using updated adv_windowlist). I only know that it works for me; your experience may vary. It might be worth noting that the name of this theme has nothing to do with what may come to mind. There may be some artefacts in here like my scroll speed settings and the scripts I have set to autorun, as well as some of my `nickcolor_expando` options. Oh, and logging. Make sure to turn that off or set it as desired (at the end of `config`). It would be best to follow rolle_'s original instructions (as linked above) and just copy the items in this repo into your irssi folder.


### What was wrong with the original?
adv_windowlist was changed so that some of the options defined in the config file are now set via `/format <option>`. I've commented the respective lines out in `config` and they are now set in `weed.theme`. I think that's it, I'll note anything else if I remember.
